## HOW TO RUN APPLICATION

1. First, ensure that you have Docker Desktop installed.
2. If necessary, pull PostgreSQL to Docker, but it shouldn't be necessary.
3. Run Docker before doing anything, it is essential that Docker is composed.
4. Run the docker command `docker-compose up -d`, other commands should not work as well.
5. Now, download the backend from the following link (https://github.com/rrleticia/PAWSIES-BACKEND)
6. With docker running, open the backend folder and run `nmp run dev`
7. Wait for gulp to compile and run the backend successfully.
8. Now, download the frontend from the following link (https://github.com/rrleticia/PAWSIES-FRONTEND)
9. With the backend running, open the frontend folder and run `nmp run dev`
10. Wait for vite to compile and run the frontend successfully.

By the end of this you should be able to use both backend and frontend.

- Backend is running on http://localhost:8080. You should be able to access it with Postman or with the Frontend.
- Frontend is runing on http://localhost:4200. You should be able to access it with any browser chosen, I develop the application with OperaGX.
